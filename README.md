# StackOverflow

## Presentation

In this project, we will implement a tags recommendation system for StackOverflow questions. StackOverflow is a reknown platform for questions and answers about programmation.

In the first notebook, we will extract the required data using the StackExchange data explorer tool, and explore the data.
In the second notebook, we will implement various machine learning algorithms and select the suitable inference model to deploy an API endpoint

## Data

The StackExchange data explorer can be use to extract information from the SQL database: [stackexchange.com](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new). Information about the database schema can be found at: [stackexchange.com](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2677/database-schema-documentation-for-the-public-data-dump-and-sede)
